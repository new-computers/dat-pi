# Standalone Dat Servers

In this repo you can find a collection of guides on how to self host [Dat](https://docs.datproject.org/) tools on Raspberry Pi and other services. Feel free to submit PRs and open issues for ideas or errors you run in to.

We are also discussing ongoing development of more simple plug &amp; play dat-pi server to improve accessibility of these tools. Please see the discussion in issues for the latest.

## Why self host

Dat is a powerful p2p protocol that enables people to publish content and information to the web from their personal computers. This fundamentally changes the relationship people have to the internet by breaking the client server hierarchy and opens the realm of self publishing to everyone. When everyone is a publisher, it becomes important for your content to be available on the internet whether your laptop/computer is on or off. With a Raspberry Pi, you can make sure this content stays online for free as long as you have an internet connection. This avoids avoiding having to rely on cloud service providers to keep our content online. This guide is the starting point for participating in this new, independent version of the internet.
