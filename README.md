# dat-rpi

Ongoing development of a simple plug &amp; play dat-pi server to improve accessibility to self hosted dats.

## Why self host

Dat is a powerful p2p protocol that enables people to publish content and information to the web from their personal computers. This fundamentally changes the relationship people have to the internet by breaking the client server hierarchy and opens the realm of self publishing to everyone. When everyone is a publisher, it becomes important for your content to be available on the internet whether your laptop/computer is on or off. With a Raspberry Pi, you can make sure this content stays online for free as long as you have an internet connection. This avoids avoiding having to rely on cloud service providers to keep our content online. This guide is the starting point for participating in this new, independent version of the internet.
